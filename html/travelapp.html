      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs,
        but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote,
        PO box… Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>

    <div class="casestudyItem problem text-center">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.
        I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="casestudyItem hypothesis text-center">
      <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
      Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Human contact: the final frontier.
      What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball
      of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>

      <p>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Jesus must be spinning in his grave!
        Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds!
        Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>

      <p>This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."
        How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname?
        We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun?
        Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs.
        Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>

      <p>Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…</p>
